# Automotive-Dataset-Statistical-Analysis
This assignment required loading the Auto MPG dataset from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Auto+MPG into a Jupyter notebook. You need to calculate the minimum, maximum, mean, and standard deviation of four attributes: MPG, displacement, horsepower, and weight. Additionally, you are required to create 12 histograms for MPG, acceleration, horsepower, and weight of cars with 4, 6, and 8 cylinders. The histograms are appropriately labeled and have appropriate ranges for each class/attribute pair. Finally, I used Markdown appropriately to create a clear and well-labeled program with results.
